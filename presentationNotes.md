# 10000 foot view

- so we've done DOM animation, SVG animation
- now we're focusing on canvas
- Scott has already taught you some canvas stuff in another course so I won't repeat

# canvas element

- delete canvas element and it should be gone
- review of canvas, place canvas element in your html, then in js modify it
- however, using this low-level access may not be your cup of tea

# createJS

- is a library built on top of canvas

# What's so great about canvas?

- read it
- [click all major browsers] link to caniuse
- the only con I've read has to do with accessibility
- [click accessibility link] - "...but the canvas content will not be accessible to screen readers"
- "SVG is a better choice for interactive content"
- something to keep in mind

# quote Adobe Animate

- read it
- [click link] - "Animate CC publishes HTML5 content using the CreateJS libraries"

# drasner question: web animation api?

# connect shared elements of a card

- read it
- what i've noticed is that it goes back to context-shifting, ensuring cognitive load doesn't shift too much so that they know where they are

# use a cascading effect

- read it
- another example of context-shifting, make sure user has a better feel of where they are

# make content push

- read it

# make menus appear in context
